# Picture In Pic

This is a small project that's possible thanks to MDN. The project will
only be working on **Chrome** as it's the most used browser.

## Instructions

As soon as you open this toy site, there is going to be a prompt that will
ask you to select which window or tab do you want to share. After you select the window/app of your choice and click **start** then a resizable window will appear.
